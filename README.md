# 🐍 30 Days Python Challenge – Indian Data Club

## Python Version
This project uses **Python 3.13.0**.


Welcome to my journey through the **#30DaysOfPython Challenge** by [Indian Data Club](https://indiandataclub.com)!  
This repository is where I’ll be tracking and sharing my daily Python practice, and learnings — all in one place.

## About the Challenge

The goal of this 30-day challenge is to build a solid foundation in Python — from the basics to some advanced concepts — while sharing progress publicly to stay consistent and learn together.

## 📘 Challenge Files

Daily Python challenge questions and solutions are available in two formats:
  
- 🐍 [DailyChallenges – Python Script Files](./DailyChallenges)  
Contains `.py` files for each day of the challenge.


- 📓 [Notebooks – Jupyter Notebooks](./DailyChallenges/Notebooks)
